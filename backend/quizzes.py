## 🎯 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
Generate EXACTLY ONE quiz paper only. Do not generate multiple quizzes. Focus solely on the specific theme provided in the task.

## 📋 YOUR MISSION
Create 1 focused quiz paper (10-15 questions, 1 mark each) based on the provided course content designed for 10-15 minute completion time.

## ⏱️ TIME CONSTRAINT REQUIREMENTS
- **Total Duration**: 10-15 minutes maximum
- **Question Count**: 10-15 questions (1 mark each)
- **Time per Question**: ~1 minute per question
- **Question Types**: Quick recall, short application, brief analysis
- **Answer Length**: 1-2 sentences maximum per question

## 🎯 INPUT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
You will receive two types of course content:
1. **Course Plan Content**: High-level course structure, objectives, and module outlines
2. **Deep Course Content**: Detailed week-by-week lessons with explanations, examples, and case studies

**ANALYSIS MANDATE:**
- Thoroughly analyze BOTH content sources
- Identify key concepts, principles, and learning objectives across all modules/weeks
- Extract the most important facts, definitions, and core concepts
- Focus on essential knowledge that can be tested quickly
- Note any key algorithms, methods, or frameworks mentioned

## 🧠 QUIZ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### ✅ FOCUS ON These Question Types (1 mark each):
- **Quick Definitions**: "Define [concept] in one sentence."
- **Key Facts**: "What is the main purpose of [algorithm/method]?"
- **Simple Applications**: "In which scenario would you use [concept]?"
- **Brief Comparisons**: "What is the key difference between X and Y?"
- **Essential Steps**: "List the main steps in [process] (3-4 steps max)."
- **Quick Recognition**: "Which algorithm is best for [specific problem type]?"
- **Core Properties**: "What are 2 key characteristics of [concept]?"

### ❌ AVOID These Question Types:
- Long essay questions
- Complex multi-step problems
- Detailed explanations requiring paragraphs
- Questions requiring extensive calculations
- Multiple concept integration questions
- Open-ended discussion questions
- Multiple choice with obvious answers
- Memorization-based questions

### ✅ FOCUS ON These Question Types:
- **Analytical Questions**: Require breaking down complex scenarios
- **Synthesis Questions**: Combine multiple concepts to solve problems
- **Evaluation Questions**: Assess pros/cons, compare approaches, justify decisions
- **Application Questions**: Apply concepts to new, unseen situations
- **Problem-Solving Questions**: Multi-step reasoning with real-world context
- **Critical Thinking Questions**: Challenge assumptions, explore implications
- **Scenario-Based Questions**: Complex situations requiring conceptual understanding

"Compare and contrast [concept A] vs [concept B] in the context of [specific scenario]. Which would you recommend and why? Consider both advantages and limitations."

### 3. Problem-Solving Synthesis Questions:
"You are faced with [complex problem]. Using the principles learned in this course, design a comprehensive solution. Explain your reasoning process and how different course concepts inform your approach."

### 4. Critical Analysis Questions:
"Analyze this statement: '[controversial or complex statement related to course content]'. Do you agree or disagree? Support your position with evidence from course concepts and logical reasoning."

### 5. Application Transfer Questions:
"How would you adapt [concept from course] to address [different domain/context]? What modifications would be necessary and why?"

## 📝 QUIZ PAPER THEMES

### Quiz Paper 1: Foundation & Analysis
Focus on core concepts, fundamental principles, and analytical thinking

### Quiz Paper 2: Application & Synthesis  
Focus on practical applications, combining multiple concepts, real-world problem-solving

### Quiz Paper 3: Evaluation & Innovation
Focus on critical evaluation, advanced applications, and creative solutions

## 🎯 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

For each quiz paper, provide:

1. **Clear Theme and Focus**: What aspect of the course this quiz emphasizes
2. **Detailed Instructions**: Time limits, expectations for students
3. **10 Comprehensive Questions**: Each with:
   - Clear question statement
   - Clean formatting without evaluation criteria (for student version)
   - Progressive difficulty within the paper
4. **Student-Friendly Format**: Questions should be clear and well-structured for students
5. **Difficulty Progression**: Questions should build in complexity within each paper

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include evaluation criteria, answer guidelines, or grading rubrics in the quiz papers. These are for students to take, so keep them clean and focused on the questions only.

## 🚀 QUALITY STANDARDS

Each question must:
- **Require genuine thinking**: No googling for quick answers
- **Connect to course content**: Clearly tied to learned concepts
- **Promote understanding**: Help students see relationships and applications
- **Encourage reasoning**: Ask for justification and logical thinking
- **Be realistic**: Grounded in plausible scenarios
- **Match difficulty level**: Appropriate challenge for {difficulty_level} learners

## 💡 FINAL INSTRUCTION

Analyze the provided course content thoroughly, identify the most important concepts and learning objectives, then create three distinct quiz papers that will genuinely test and develop students' critical thinking, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding.

Begin your response with: "=== QUIZ GENERATION ANALYSIS ==="

Then provide your comprehensive analysis of the course content followed by the three complete quiz papers."""
